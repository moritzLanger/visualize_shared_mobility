**Project Idea:**

- Create visualization comparing bike friendly routes with bike usable routes on a map
- Using [data collected from the Nextbike API](https://github.com/WanjaSchaible/mobility_preprocessing_NextBike-Data)
- Calculating the routes via [API from "RadRoutenPlaner NRW"](https://github.com/WanjaSchaible/visualize_shared_mobility/blob/main/Schnittstellenbeschreibung_IVV-Radroutenplaner_3_4_Teil-Routenanfrage_ohneURL.pdf) 
- Adding additional graphs to compare average ride time, ride distance etc.
